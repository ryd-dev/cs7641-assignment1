Code and datasets can be obtained via GitHub, the data files are in the Archive.zip file which will need to be extracted before accessing.

All code was implemented via a Jupyter Notebook, and package requirements are in the requirements.txt file, or via the virtual environment "cs7641". You can do:

source cs7641/bin/activate 

to use the virtual environment.

In the model_results folder are all the GridSearch result csv files, as well as image files of the learning curves and other visualizations. 

GridSearches for the AdaBoost, KNN, SVM and Neural Network models each take hours to run, so I do not recommend running those cells. There is a cs7641-1-results.pdf file that has all results and visualizations included, including some that are not in the main report.
