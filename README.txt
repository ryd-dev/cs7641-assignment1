Code and datasets can be obtained via GitHub, the data files are in the Archive.zip file which will need to be extracted before accessing.

All code was implemented via a Jupyter Notebook, and package requirements are in the requirements.txt file.

In the model_results folder are all the GridSearch result csv files, as well as image files of the learning curves and other visualizations.

GridSearches for the AdaBoost, KNN, SVM and Neural Network models each take hours to run, so I do not recommend running those cells. They've been commented out, and replaced with renderings of the csv results or the relevant visualizations.
